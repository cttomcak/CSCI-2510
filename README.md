# CSCI-2510
Simple JavaScript Engine and Games For CSCI 2510

This repository was originally going to have two games in it, Budget Mario and Enhanced Snake. I did not have time to complete Enhanced Snake. (It works, but is neither in the correct architecture or fully functional). However, Budget Mario fulfills the requirements for our final project by itself.

The game engine is obviously heavily inspired by (and transcribed from) Dr. Brian Ricks' game engine, which we worked on all semester.

Budget Mario Controls:  
A sprint button wasn't in the budget. Therefore, you're always sprinting :D  
Press your arrowkeys to move.  
When you get a fire-flower, press 'a' to shoot fireballs.
